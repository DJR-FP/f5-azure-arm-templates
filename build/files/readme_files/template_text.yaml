  standalone_1nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a single NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard Cloud design where the compute instance of F5 is running with a single interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed.  This is a traditional model in the cloud where the deployment is considered one-armed.'
  standalone_2nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a 2-NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure.  In a 2-NIC implementation, one interface is for management and one is for data-plane traffic, each with a unique public/private IP. This is a variation of the 3-NIC template without the NIC for connecting directly to backend webservers.'
  standalone_3nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard "on-premise like" cloud design where the compute instance of F5 is running with a management, front-end application traffic(Virtual Server) and back-end application interface.'
  standalone_multi_nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure, the solution can optionally also add additional NIC(s) to the BIG-IP to be used as needed. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard "on-premise like" cloud design where the compute instance of F5 is running with a management, front-end application traffic(Virtual Server) and back-end application interface.'

  ha-avset: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch two BIG-IP VEs in an Active/Standby configuration with network failover enabled. Each pair of BIG-IP VEs is deployed in an Azure Availability Set, and can therefore be spread across different update and fault domains. Each BIG-IP VE has 3 network interfaces (NICs), one for management, one for external traffic, and one for internal traffic.\n\nTraffic flows from the client through BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard 'on-premise-like' cloud design where the compute instance of F5 is running with a management interface, a front-end application traffic (external) interface, and back-end application (internal) interface. This template is a result of Azure now supporting multiple public-to-private IP address mappings per NIC. \n\nThis template supports creating up to 8 additional public/private IP address configurations for the external 'application' NIC to be used for passing traffic to BIG-IP virtual servers.  Each virtual server should be configured with a destination address matching the private IP address value of the Azure IP configuration receiving traffic for the application. In the event the active BIG-IP VE becomes unavailable, the IP configuration(s) are migrated using network failover, seamlessly shifting application traffic to the current active BIG-IP VE.\n\nThe template also supports updating the next hop of Azure User-Defined Routes (UDRs) to use the active BIG-IP VEs internal self IP address. Specify a comma-delimited list of managedRoutes and a routeTableTag in the template to define the UDRs to be updated.  All UDRs with destinations matching managedRoutes and configured in Azure Route Tables tagged with 'f5_ha:<routeTableTag>' will use the active BIG-IP VE as the next hop for those routes."
  ltm_autoscale: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch the deployment of F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) Virtual Edition (VE) instances in a Microsoft Azure VM Scale Set that is configured for auto scaling. Traffic flows from the Azure load balancer to the BIG-IP VE (cluster) and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. As traffic increases or decreases, the number of BIG-IP VE LTM instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly.  Scaling thresholds are currently based on *network out* throughput. This solution is for BIG-IP LTM only.'

  service_principal: 'This template requires service principal.  See the [Service Principal Setup section](#service-principal-authentication) for details.'
  post_config: 'This template has some optional post-deployment configuration.  See the [Post-Deployment Configuration section](#post-deployment-configuration) for details.'
  rg_limit: 'This template requires that the resource group name the deployment uses to be no longer than **35** characters as a result of limitations to tag size within Azure.'
  nic_sizing: 'Since this template allows you to deploy a variable number of NIC''s be sure to pick an Azure Virtual Machine instance size that can support the number of NIC''s chosen, otherwise the deployment will fail.  Please see the [Azure Instance Size link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/#size-tables) to determine the correct instance size to coorespond with the number of NIC''s required. NOTE: This solution deploys three NIC''s plus a variable number of NIC''s as specified in the parameter **numberOfAdditionalNics**'
  addtl_nic_config: 'As a result of this template deploying a variable number of NIC''s using the parameter **numberOfAdditionalNics** it will pre-configure the BIG-IP VLAN(s) and place the interfaces into the cooresponding VLAN (based on the subnet name(s) inputted in **additionalNicLocation**).  Please be aware that after template deployment the self IP(s) will need to be created cooresponding to the Azure IP config object for that NIC, also setting the IP Config object to a **static** address instead of **dynamic** will be necessary to ensure it doesnt change on reboot.'

  supported: 'Because this template has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K40701984).'
  experimental: 'While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the experimental directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.'
