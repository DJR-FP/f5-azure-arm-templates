# Deploying the BIG-IP VE in Azure - Two NIC + Webserver(s)

[![Slack Status](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com)
[![Doc Status](http://readthedocs.org/projects/f5-sdk/badge/?version=latest)](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-1-0.html)

## Introduction

- This solution implements an ARM Template to deploy a full stack example of F5 in a two NIC deployment, it also deploys a web server and configures F5 to pass traffic to that web server.

- In a two NIC implementation, interface #1 is for management and data-plane traffic from the Internet, and interface #2 is connected into the Azure networks where traffic is processed by the pool members in a traditional two-ARM design.

## Documentation

The ***BIG-IP Virtual Edition and Microsoft Azure: Setup*** guide (https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-1-0.html) decribes how to create the configuration manually without using the ARM template.

## Installation

You have three options for deploying this template:
  - Using the Azure deploy button
  - Using [PowerShell](#powershell)

### <a name="azure"></a>Azure deploy button

Use this button to deploy the template:

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FF5Networks%2Ff5-azure-arm-templates%2Fmaster%2Fexperimental%2Freference%2Fstandalone%2F2nic+webserver%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">

</a>

### Template parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| adminUsername | x | A user name to login to the BIG-IPs.  The default value is "azureuser". |
| adminPassword | x | A strong password for the BIG-IPs. Remember this password; you will need it later. |
| dnsLabel | x | Unique DNS Name for the public IP address used to access the BIG-IPs for management. |
| instanceName | x | The hostname to be configured for the VM. |
| instanceType | x | The desired Azure Virtual Machine instance size. |
| imageName | x | The desired F5 image to deploy. |
| licenseKey1 | x | The license token from the F5 licensing server. This license will be used for the first F5 BIG-IP. |
| webServer | x | The example web server to deploy. |
| vsPort | x | The virtual server port to use when configuring the BIG-IP. |
| restrictedSrcAddress | x | Restricts management access to a specific network or address. Enter a IP address or address range in CIDR notation, or asterisk for all sources. |
| tagValues | x | Additional key-value pair tags to be added to each Azure resource. |


### <a name="powershell"></a>PowerShell Script Example

```powershell
    # Params below match to parameteres in the azuredeploy.json that are gen-unique, otherwsie pointing to
    # the azuredeploy.parameters.json file for default values.  Some options below are mandatory, some(such as deployment password for BIG IP)
    # can be supplied inline when running this script but if they arent then the default will be used as specificed in below param arguments
    # Example Command: .\Deploy_via_PS.ps1 -adminUsername azureuser -adminPassword yourpassword -dnsLabel f52nicdeploy01 -instanceName f52nic -licenseKey1 XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX -webServer Both -vsPort 443 -resourceGroupName f52nicdeploy01

    param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
    [string]
    $adminUsername,

    [string]
    $templateFilePath = "azuredeploy.json",

    [string]
    $parametersFilePath = "azuredeploy.parameters.json"
    )

    Write-Host "Disclaimer: Scripting to Deploy F5 Solution templates into Cloud Environments are provided as examples. They will be treated as best effort for issues that occur, feedback is encouraged." -foregroundcolor green
    Start-Sleep -s 3

    # Connect to Azure, right now it is only interactive login
    try {

        Write-Host "Already logged in, continuing..."
        }
        Catch {
        Write-Host "Not logged in, please login..."
        Login-AzureRmAccount
        }

    # Create Resource Group for ARM Deployment
    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location "$region"

    # Create Arm Deployment
    $pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $adminPassword -AsPlainText -Force
    $deployment = New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name $resourceGroupName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateFile $templateFilePath -TemplateParameterFile $parametersFilePath -Verbose -adminUsername "$adminUsername" -adminPassword $pwd -dnsLabel "$dnsLabel" -instanceName "$instanceName" -instanceType "$instanceType" -licenseKey1 "$licenseKey1" -restrictedSrcAddress "$restrictedSrcAddress" -imageName "$imageName" -webServer $webServer -vsPort $vsPort

    # Print Output of Deployment to Console
    $deployment
```

## Design Patterns

The goal is for the design patterns for all the iterative examples of F5 being deployed via ARM templates to closely match as much as possible.

### List of Patterns For Contributing Developers


 1. Still working on patterns to use

## Filing Issues

See the Issues section of `Contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.

## Contributing

See `Contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

## Test


Before you open a pull request, your code must have passed a deployment into Azure with the intended result

## Unit Tests

Simply deploying the ARM template and completing use case fulfills a functional test
